This one is for my beloved [Senior](https://www.facebook.com/rohitvarkey),
Today is your birthday Varkey(Workey : which makes more sense), Thanks for opening my eyes. I still remember sitting in the first bench when you started speaking about the Projects that were going on in our club, and ended up in high level Julia stuff. Though, I was too dumb to get all those tecn stuff, I was wondering how did you recall all that next level stuff and presented it. I still wonder how you manage your day.
That aimless day, when I opened my github profile had nothing, I mean I dint even know how to use Git then. Those were the days when I thought git is the place where we search our projects. <br> So I Started stocking the git profiles of some people whom I knew.
The first one and easily available one on my Git home page was [Varkey's](https://github.com/rohitvarkey). where I read about jekyll site. It dint take me much time complete the site, by having a look at well written Jekyll documentation.

Thanks for everything you've done for us , to all the Gyan you've left for us, and concern you had for us Varkey. Thanks a lot......
